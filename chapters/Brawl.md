# Brawl

The footsteps sounded like normal people, but it sounded _too_ normal. It sounded exactly like a professional that didn't want to give away how lithely they moved. These people were definitely well-trained. I sneaked over to the little window next to the door, hoping to catch a glimpse as to who my potential opponents were.

I never had the chance.

The door burst open and the shockwaves knocked me backwards onto the floor. A burly figure picked me up by the shoulders; I was still slightly disoriented then I was thrown against the wall. The wall gave way with a crash. I needed to get up and defend myself. I willed my body to get up. My hands curled. My thighs flexed. I got up and stood to face my attacker.

My attacker was a masked person, wearing only a balaclava. The body was covered in Kevlar, heavy boots designed to withstand punishment encapsulated their feet. Their hands were gloved with scarlet leather gloves. Obviously to avoid fingerprints. This person knew how to make a statement and leave no trace. The most dangerous kind of person. I'll call this person Smiley. Cause I'll be smiling after this guy's dead.

I squared up and took my approach. I fiented with my left fist. Smiley avoided it. Bad move. Smiley was not prepared for the right straight that was hurtling towards their skull. I've destroyed hundreds of people with this right straight. No one was gonna avoid it nor could they come back and defeat me after being hit by it. There was no way I'd lose.

Smiley grabbed my forearm and used my own momentum to take me off balance and slam me into the ground. I groaned in pain. Smiley still had their leather hands on my forearm. I attempted to wrest free, but their grip was too strong. A boot dug into my shoulder; my arm was being pulled in the opposite direction. No matter how tough I was, shoulder dislocation wasn't something I actively wished to experience. I frantically looked around for anything that could save me from this predicament. I did not.

I decided to bend over and lift my legs upwards towards Smiley's neck, trapping them in a scissor hold. We were at a stalemate now.

"Dislocate my arm, I snap your neck." I growled.

"The Behemoth sends its regards." There was that weird-ass telepathic talk again.

"Speak with your voice, not this mind-beam shit!" I yelled while tightening my grip.

Eventually, Smiley let go, but I did not. I used this opportunity to lift my upper body up and get on top. My knees were now directly in contact with Smiley's ears. If I so wished, I could end this fight right now. I didn't want to, I wanted more information. This was the only time that a single enemy approached me. Was this The Behemoth's way of saying that it accepted me as a target and started sending more skilled people after me? I had to know. I reached towards the balaclava and tore it off.

Long red hair billowed out, free from the clutches of the mask. I jumped off, thinking that it was blood. Smiley turned around to face me. It was a woman. She had delicate features: high cheekbones, a chin that slowly curved alongside her profile, and stone gray eyes. I studied her face a little longer and noticed a long black mark starting from the right side of her forehead, eventually making its way down to the opposite side of her neck. I'd never seen this kind of mark before. Every other person that was sent to destroy me had no mark.

"What is the meaning of this?" I asked.

"I've been sent to...exsanguinate you." the woman replied.

I wasn't having any of it. It was clear to me that this person was different than most of the others and most likely had more information. I had to capture her and interrogate her. She moved before I did, dropping to the floor. She ran along the floor and caught up within a foot in front of me before I could even react. Whoever, whatever she was, she was definitely not human. Maybe more than human? I felt a gloved hand tighten around my throat. I clawed at it to no avail. My windpipe was being encroached and I could feel my feet leaving the ground. Was I being picked up? I couldn't tell. I was losing oxygen, my strength was leaving me, a small black vignette slowly encircled across my view.
