# Thunder

I stood in the rain, listening for the crack of thunder to pass the time. I look down and I see the life leak from me; the blood of those that sought to destroy me lay strewn about. I look back up towards the sky, hoping to see a respite from the despair that so greatly enveloped me. I could not get any reprieve from my own deeds. Truly, it was death of my own making.

Calling upon every iota of the energy I had left, I willed my brain to send electric signals to my muscles. _Move,_ I told them. My joints screamed, my nerves shot fireworks in protest, but I ignored them. I was, and still am, the master of my own body. I groaned as I got up. Then I limped the twenty feet to my car. Landing in the soft leather seat of the Camaro was a familiar feeling. I put the key in the ignition and started old Bertha up. She'd been a gift to me from my father all those years ago. I'll need to get her fixed up. She's been a bit banged up from what happened just now.

I drove away, never to return, the destruction shrinking in my rearview mirror as the forest slowly swallowed it up.
