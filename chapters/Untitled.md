# Untitled Diary entry

_September 15th, 1790_

Dearest Lucretia,

If you are reading this, then Thomas arrived safely and I am already dead. I write to you in fear that I may not have long for this world. The Behemoth is currently chasing after me. I have been marked with the Intersection. The church has repeatedly ignored my pleas for sanctuary and I have nowhere else to turn apart from the mail carrier's office in which I write to you, my lovely Lucretia. Take Philip and flee the country. The Behemoth is a man of indomitable fury. There are stories in which The Behemoth razed the town of Trayt, laid waste to entire orchards in Yulip, and toppled King Franke's empire with nary a single breath.

I beseech you, forget about me. Forget the name SÃ­mon Gurag, and start over anew. Do not carve out a place for me in your heart; that is a void that will never be filled again. Again, I implore that you escape The Behemoth.

How can you kill that which has no soul?
